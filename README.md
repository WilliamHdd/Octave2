# Octave2
You'll find in this repository the work asked for our second lab session on Octave.

I choosed to create a program that will give you the least visited days. It's supposed to help compagnies and amusement parcs to know 
when to close without loosing lots of clients. 
I choosed to simultate the frequentation of a parc with a random matrix. This is obviously not representative of a real distribution !!
To get representative number you schould enter manualy real numbers every day to get after 1 year a graph of your real distribution.
